Here goes nothing!

This project is going to be a collection of stuff that I do over my 2012 summer. It might end up being a single large game, it might end up being a bunch of cool little experiments I try, or I might give up entirely and play Minecraft all summer. Either way (unless it's the third option) it should be fun, educational experience.
